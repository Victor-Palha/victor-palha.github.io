# Hello There
My name is Victor Palha and i'm a software engineer. You maybe know me from my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/Victor-Palha) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-palha/). Anyway, this is my personal blog where i will share my thoughts and experiences about software development and other topics. I hope you enjoy it! but if you don't, well... i don't care.

## About Me
I'm a software engineer with a passion for technology and software development. I have experience in a wide range of technologies and programming languages, including Python, TypeScript, and Elixir. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. I started my career as a software engineer in 2020 when i started college and i have been working in the industry ever since. I have worked on a variety of projects, including web applications, mobile apps, and backend services. I'm currently working as a freelance developer, but i'm always open to new opportunities.

## How i created this blog?
This blog was created using Jekyll, a static site generator that allows you to create simple and fast websites. I chose Jekyll because it's easy to use and has a lot of features that make it easy to create a blog. I also used GitHub Pages to host the blog, which is a free and easy way to host static websites. I hope you enjoy reading my blog as much as i enjoyed creating it!
