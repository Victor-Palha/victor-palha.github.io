To start this article I want to say that I'm a software developer with a few years of experience in the field, and I have worked with several programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Elixir and etc. But I never had the opportunity to work with Java, I mean, I've already did some college projects with Java when I was studying, but I never had the opportunity to work with Java in a professional environment.

## What changed?
If you are reading this article, you probably know that my main language is JS/TS, and I'm a fullstack developer, but I'm not happy with some things that I'm seeing in the JS/TS ecosystem... I could argue that i can use Elixir for backend and i **really** love Elixir, but the Elixir opportunities are not so common unfortunately, so I decided to learn Java and start my journey with this language... I mean... What possibly could go wrong?

## Why Java?
I know that Java is a language that has been around for a long time, but the most important thing is that Java has a strong type system, and I really like strong type systems, so I think that Java is a good choice for me! And also, Java is a language that is widely used in the industry, so I think that learning Java can open a lot of doors for me!
Well... To be honest, I'm a little bit scared! What if I don't like Java? What if I just lose my time learning something that I will not use in the future? But I think that I need to take this risk, and I'm really excited to start this journey!

## Others opinions
When i was looking around for my studies, I found some pretty exciting languages like Rust and Go, and i was in doubt about which language to learn, i mean, Rust and Go are languages that are growing a lot in the industry... But in the end of the day __programming language is just a tool__, and I think that Java will be a good new tool for me! And after Java, who knows? Maybe I will learn Rust or Go... Or **ASSERMBLY**! (Just kidding... Am I?)

## Conclusion
Anyway, this is just what i was thinking and since this is my blog, I can write whatever I want! But I'm really excited to start this journey with Java, and I will share my experiences here, so if you are interested in Java, stay tuned! And if you have any tips for me, please let me know! I will be very grateful!
